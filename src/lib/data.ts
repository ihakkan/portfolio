    description: 'An adaptive K-12 learning platform that reshapes the curriculum around each student, with a 24/7 AI mentor.',
    longDescription: 'OHMSchool is a school shaped like the student. Instead of pushing every child through a fixed syllabus, an adaptive engine reroutes the curriculum through whatever the learner already loves — teaching quadratics through the arc of a skateboard ollie, or structural engineering through the ramp they skate on. It pairs interest-driven lesson generation with a 24/7 AI mentor, multilingual support by default, and learning maps that track mastery in real time. Built and shipped at Persist; now enrolling for Fall 2026.',
    why: 'The classroom model was built in 1894 and it still assumes every kid learns the same way at the same pace. I wanted to prove the opposite is buildable: that a curriculum can bend to the student instead of the other way around, and that an AI mentor available at 3am is worth more than a syllabus nobody chose.',

    longDescription: 'AURA is the UI for OpenClaw: speak or type your intent and it drives your actual desktop to the outcome — booking a flight, applying to a job, summarising an inbox. Rather than wrapping rigid REST APIs, it pilots the real interface layer with full DOM reasoning across nested frames, backed by always-listening streaming speech-to-text, encrypted identity and form memory, a verify-before-act protocol, and fully local isolated execution so nothing runs on a remote container. Currently in v0.2 open beta, built in the open at Persist.',
    why: 'Most "AI automation" breaks the moment a site changes a class name, because it is really just a brittle script wearing a model as a hat. I wanted an agent that reasons about the interface the way a person does — look, decide, verify, act — and that runs on your own machine so the automation never costs you your privacy.',

Features include a beautiful dashboard, daily limits (max 5 commits), email notifications, and Discord webhook analytics integration.',
    why: 'I built Commit Habit to solve a common developer challenge - maintaining GitHub activity streaks during busy periods. Traditional solutions require Personal Access Tokens which pose security risks. By building a GitHub App instead, I created a more secure, transparent, and user-controllable solution.

export const ABOUT_ME = "Fullstack AI Engineer at Persist, where I treat the model, the backend and the pixels as one single product. I won Persist's Startupathon against 250+ builders in February 2026, turned down two campus placements to take the job, and finished my B.Tech in CSE that July with two live products already shipped — OHMSchool, an adaptive K-12 learning platform, and AURA, a desktop agent that operates your computer through real DOM reasoning. I build AI agents that act on real interfaces, the fullstack machinery that keeps them reliable, and the UI that makes the intelligence feel obvious. Based in India, building remotely for four continents."
