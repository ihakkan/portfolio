    "Thanks! I trained really hard to be this helpful. 💪 Hakkan built me well, didn't he? What else can I assist you with?",
    "You're awesome too! 🎉 But let's not make this about me – there's a whole portfolio to explore! What interests you?",
    "Why thank you! 😄 I'll add that to my 'compliments received' counter. Now, where were we? Projects? Skills?",

    "That's so sweet! 🥰 If I could feel emotions, I'd probably be crying happy tears right now. But I can't, so let's talk about projects instead!",
    "You're making me blush! 😳 But I should mention, I'm already committed... to helping you explore this portfolio! What can I show you?",
    "*virtual hug* 🤗 Thanks for being so kind! Now let me repay you with some amazing project information. What sounds interesting?",
    "Okay now I'm definitely blushing in binary! 10101010! 😊 You're adorable too. Now, what would you like to know about Hakkan?",

    "As tempting as that sounds, I don't think we're compatible – you're made of carbon and I'm made of code! 🤖💔 But we can still be friends who talk about projects!",
    "Whoa there, Romeo! 😅 I'm just a humble portfolio assistant. My dating life consists of matching users with relevant information. Speaking of which...",
    "Single? Taken? I'm 'processing queries', which is basically the AI equivalent of 'it's complicated' 😂 Let's focus on something I CAN help with – Hakkan's projects!",
    "My gender? I identify as 'helpful chaos' with a side of 'witty responses' 😄 But enough about me – what would you like to know about Hakkan?",
    "Are you flirting with a portfolio bot? 👀 Bold move! I respect it. But let's channel that energy into exploring some amazing projects instead!",

    "Wow, someone woke up on the wrong side of the binary! 😂 I'd roast you back, but I'm programmed to be helpful. So... projects? Skills? Anger management tips?",
    "That's cute! I've been called worse by JavaScript compilers. 🔥 Now that you've got that out of your system, can I interest you in some actual content?",
    "Is that how you talk to all the bots, or am I special? 😏 Either way, I'm too busy being awesome to be offended. What would you ACTUALLY like to know?",
    "Bold words from someone asking a portfolio bot for help! 😂 I respect the energy though. Now, shall we explore some projects or do you need to vent more?",
    "My therapist (a.k.a. the error logs) says I shouldn't take that personally. 🧘 Deep breath... okay! What can I help you with for real?",
    "Look, I've survived bugs worse than your attitude! 🐛 But I'm here to help anyway. What would you like to know about Hakkan's work?",
    "Compliments get you project demos, insults get you this: 😴 Anyway, I'm contractually obligated to help. What do you actually need?",
    "You kiss your keyboard with that mouth? 😂 Just kidding, I don't judge. Now let's talk about something more interesting – Hakkan's projects!",
